The technology stack used for development: Apache Cordova to wrap the webapp to be installed as native, grunt.js for compiling, require.js for modularity of the js code, hammer.js for touch gestures and sass as the css pre-precessor.
  The app consists on a geolocation alarm. It is currently available in the iOS appstore. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waykup/id817714891?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">Download now!</a></p>

              <p>*Known as Preguntados in spanish.</p>
              <p>Number one mobile game in the App Store and Google Play for several months worldwide.</p>
              <p>I was part of a 3 members team developing the front-end of the game for the web. The challenge, as all games, was to care of animations that should perform at a constant 60fps.</p>
              <p>For the technology stack, we used Grunt, Backbone and Less as the css preprocessor.</p>
              <p>Currently the webapp is used in a very well known TV show in Argentina.</p>

              <p>Was part of a 2 memebers team. The work consisted of a complete refactor of the code with a new stack of technology focusing on maintainability. Also new features were added with a complete re-design of the app.</p>
              <p>The game consits in a async online crossword puzzle. It is very successful in Spain.</p>

              <p>It's a real-time bingo game with sockets.</p>
              <p>Developed the whole UI of the game, including all animations. First made all of them with the greenSock JS animation library, but they weren't performing as fluid as desired, so I migrated them to CSS3 using hardware accelerated animations. Compared performance of each one of them cross-browser using developer tools and fps meters. In conclusion made the perfect blend between greenSock and CSS3 animations.</p>
